# navigation codotype
An interactive, code-based prototype AKA codotype built with Astro and SolidJS.

The ```src/components/menus``` folder has the two components and the ```MENUS.js``` you can edit to see your navigation data – your application's information architecture – rendered as a horizontal navigation bar or as a vertical navigation panel. 

Wouldn't it be nice if this just worked?

Yes, it sure would be.
